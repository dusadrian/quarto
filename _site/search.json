    "title": "Significant speed increase in package QCA",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The upcoming release version 3.23 of the package QCA will bring a significant speed increase for the minimization process, by a factor of about 10 times on my computer. This achievement has two sources:\n\nparallelizing the search process to find the prime implicants\nadding the option to use the Gurobi optimizer for solving the prime implicants chart\n\nThe parallelization process is made possible by using the OpenMP API, which is available on most modern systems. Depending on the workstation’s architecture, the speed increase is larger and larger the more cores are available. In my case, the parallelization accounts for about 7 times, on a MacBookPro with a M2 Max processor having 12 cores.\nUsing OpenMP, however, is not automatically enabled by the CRAN servers. It needs to be installed by the user on the local machine, and at least for the MacOS systems CRAN has some detailed instructions on how to do this. I did not find similar instructions for the Windows systems, but I assume that Rtools should be installed.\nThese command line tools are necessary to re-build the package QCA from source, to enable the OpenMP API. Installing this local version of the package, assuming that OpenMP is available, will do the trick.\nThe next speed improvement factor is due to the Gurobi optimizer. By default, the package QCA uses the open source lpSolve package to solve the prime implicants chart. This is a very good solver, but it has obvious limits at very large and sparce such charts. Gurobi, on the other hand, is a different story. It is the fastest, industrial strength solver, that was recently made available for no cost for academic users.\n\n\n\nThe figure above shows the difference in speed between Gurobi and lpSolve, for randomly generated PI charts with 60 to 70 columns (the equivalent of the observed positive configurations / minterms in QCA) and 1000 prime implicants on the rows. The difference is almost exponential, in some situations Gurobi is up to 100 times faster, with an average of 35 times for the maximum of 70 columns.\nWhen package QCA detects the Gurobi solver, it will use that instead of lpSolve, and revert back only if there is something wrong in the solving process (for instance Gurobi might not find a valid license, and stop with an error).\nKudos to the Gurobi team for making this solver available, it makes a massive point of improvement for the Boolean minimization process. Users have to register on the Gurobi website, using their institutional email address, and request an academic license key that can be used to activate the Gurobi package. They also provide detailed instructions on how to install the R package gurobi.\nOnce these are installed, package QCA will do the rest and, function of the number of available cores, will show a dramatic increase in speed.\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{dușa2024,\n  author = {Dușa, Adrian},\n  title = {Significant Speed Increase in Package {QCA}},\n  date = {2024-10-03},\n  url = {https://adriandusa.eu/posts/2024-10-03-qca-openmp-gurobi/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDușa, Adrian. 2024. “Significant Speed Increase in Package\nQCA.” October 3, 2024. https://adriandusa.eu/posts/2024-10-03-qca-openmp-gurobi/."

    "section": "",
    "text": "As a former SPSS trained user, ever since I started using R there was always a rather annoying background question: why is there a single missing value in base R, and why isn’t it possible to use more missing values?\nAs far as I understand, the main reason might have something to do with the scientific domain of the original R creators, who were definitely not from the social sciences. A single missing value is more than enough for any other scientific domain, and R simply went on the original design, ignoring the use of multiple missing values that are universally offered by all other major statistical software like SAS, SPSS and Stata.\nMore recently, some good initiatives led to the packages haven and labelled, who are almost (but not) perfect. In this post, I am going to write about my own solution to this situation, published on CRAN in the package declared.\nThis package offers a custom type of vector, that is not different from regular R vectors in the sense that it contains exactly the same missing values, so normal functionality is maintained for any statistical operation. What it additionally does, is to keep a record of the position of each and every missing value, and assign meaning to those positions. This way, it achieves the best of both worlds: declare and use multiple missing values, whilst being fully compatible with base R design.\nThe following is an illustrative example, for a hypothetical variable about the number of children in a household:\nlibrary(declared)\nchildren &lt;- declared(\n  c(2, -91, 0, 3, -92, 4, 2, 1, 0, 3, -91, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, -91, 2, 5, 2, 1, 3),\n  label = \"Number of children in the household\",\n  labels = c(\"Prefer not to say\" = -91, \"Not applicable\" = -92),\n  na_values = c(-91, -92)\n)\n#&gt; &lt;declared&lt;integer&gt;[22]&gt; Number of children in the household\n#&gt;  [1]       2 NA(-91)       0       3 NA(-92)       4       2       1       0\n#&gt; [10]       3 NA(-91)       0       1       2       1       0 NA(-91)       2\n#&gt; [19]       5       2       1       3\n#&gt; Missing values: -91, -92\n\n#&gt; Labels:\n#&gt;  value             label\n#&gt;    -91 Prefer not to say\n#&gt;    -92    Not applicable\nThe values -91 and -92 are properly declared and recognised as missing, as it can be seen in the print method which prepends the NA in front of the value.\nLet’s see how this vector looks in base R:\nbaseRchildren &lt;- drop(children)\n#&gt; [1]  2 NA  0  3 NA  4  2  1  0  3 NA  0  1  2  1  0 NA  2  5  2  1  3\nAny statistical operation, even basic descriptives, on such vectors results into an NA:\nmean(baseRchildren)\n#&gt; [1] NA\nIn R, the value NA is equivalent to an empty cell (with no information about why it is missing) and this requires attention. To obtain the expected result, one has to employ the argument na.rm (remove missing values before calculating the mean), deactivated by default to alert users about potential problems in the data.\nmean(baseRchildren, na.rm = TRUE)\n#&gt; [1] 1.777778\nHowever, in this particular example the values are not “empty”. There are particular and known reasons for each value where the number of children is not provided, hence these values should not be problematic. Package declared solves this by default:\nmean(children)\n#&gt; [1] 1.777778\nIn this example, the argument na.rm is not necessary because the (declared) NA values are not empty cells, despite being stored as regular NA values. For this reason, a dedicated function is provided, called is.empty(), to differentiate between pure NA and the four declared missing values:\nsum(is.na(children))\n#&gt; [1] 4\n\nsum(is.empty(children))\n#&gt; [1] 0\n\n# adding one pure empty value\nsum(is.empty(c(children, NA)))\n#&gt; [1] 1\nDeclared vectors are useful for both numeric and categorical variables. In fact, missing values can be recorded no matter what kind of variables there are in a dataset. In addition to declaring such values, it is in fact possible to also declare value labels for the response categories, to create a special kind of object that is inbetween numerical vectors and R factors.\norientation &lt;- declared(\n  c(1:3, -91),\n  labels = c(\"Left\" = 1, \"Middle\" = 2, \"Right\" = 3, \"Don't know\" = -91),\n  na_value = -91,\n  label = \"Respondent's political orientation\"\n)\n#&gt; &lt;declared&lt;integer&gt;[4]&gt; Respondent's political orientation\n#&gt; [1]       1       2       3 NA(-91)\n#&gt; Missing values: -91\n\n#&gt; Labels:\n#&gt;  value     label\n#&gt;     1       Left\n#&gt;     2     Middle\n#&gt;     3      Right\n#&gt;   -91 Don't know\nThis is a typical example of a categorical variable, with all values corresponding to certain ordered categories. The only possible way to emulate this in base R is to use a factor:\nfactor(\n  c(\"Left\", \"Middle\", \"Right\", \"Don't know\"),\n  levels = c(\"Left\", \"Middle\", \"Right\", \"Don't know\"),\n  ordered = TRUE\n)\n#&gt; [1] Left       Middle     Right      Don't know\n#&gt; Levels: Left &lt; Middle &lt; Right &lt; Don't know\nR factors are unable to differentiate between valid categories and those which should be treated as missing, and the order of the categories needs to be specified separately using the argument levels. In addition, the original (questionnaire) values are lost, for instance the value -91 can not be preserved.\nUnlike R factors, in the declared counterpart the values are still there, and labels are assigned for each category. To meet the expectations of various statistical procedures that allow for categorical variables, the function as.factor() coerces the vector:\nas.factor(orientation, ordered = TRUE)\n#&gt; [1] Left   Middle Right  &lt;NA&gt;\n#&gt; Levels: Left &lt; Middle &lt; Right\nThis is the expected behavior, since the value -91 corresponding to the category “Don’t know” is to be treated as missing, anyways. The declared missing values are correctly coerced to base R NA values.\nThere are many other utility functions in this package, probably too many to describe in a single post.

    "text": "The European Social Survey is the most advanced academic survey in Europe, with over 20 years of collecting data every two years.\nIt is organised on rounds, with core and rotating modules which means questions names (or numbers) are not fixed from one round to another. To integrate the datasets from multiple countries and multiple rounds, ESS uses a mnemonic system, for instance PPLTRST referring to the question if most people can be trusted. This question was named A4 in round 8 and it can have different other names in other rounds.\nWhile using a mnemonic system is the only solution with integrated data files, it makes the life of regular users somewhat difficult if searching for a particular variable in a particular round. The connection with the questionnaire gets lost, as the name A4 from the questionnaire is not found in the dataset for round 8.\nIt is in fact a Frequently Asked Question, found in the Data section at question: “How do I use question numbers as variable names?”. The ESS provided solution is to use software specific script files, and rename variables from the mnemonic system to the actual question names from the ESS questionnaire.\nThe current scripts cover the needs of most ESS users, with different versions written for SAS, SPSS and Stata. However (and this is a general matter which will soon be addressed by ESS) there is no such script for the R programming environment, which is also in high demand.\nUntil there will be an R version of the ESS datasets, one possible solution is to download any of the currently provided versions (for instance SPSS) and convert it into an R data frame using the package DDIwR. The big advantage of this package, besides converting to and from various statistical software, is to create a special type of R object where each variable is a vector of class “declared”, via another recent package called declared, which allows R users to define specific missing values in a similar fashion as most users do in SPSS, Stata or SAS (this was not directly possible until now, given that base R has one and only one type of missing value, NA).\nBelow is an actual example of how to convert, also containing the code to rename the ESS round 8 variables:\n# Encoding: UTF-8.\n# RENAME ESS round 8\n# The program renames variable names from mnemomic to question numbers,\n# for example NWSPOL to A1.\n# Exceptions are country specific variables (party, education etc.)\n# and variables from the household grid (F2, F3 and F4).\n# -----\n\noldvar &lt;- c(\n    \"nwspol\", \"netusoft\", \"netustm\", \"ppltrst\", \"pplfair\", \"pplhlp\", \"polintr\",\n    \"psppsgva\", \"actrolga\",

    "title": "CCubes and CNA",
    "section": "",
    "text": "I’ve recently came across a recent manuscript called called “Optimizing Consistency and Coverage in Configurational Causal Modeling”, by Michael Baumgartner and Mathias Ambühl (in the next sections, abbreviated as B&A).\nB&A propose an interesting method to find the optimal thresholds for consistency and coverage, to recover the underlying causal structure.\nWithout starting another debate around CNA vs. QCA, it remains to be seen (and I will probably test) if their idea to find such optimal thresholds is possible / desirable for QCA truth tables.\nThe purpose of this post is to offer some explanation, since the authors referred to my minimization algorithm called CCubes.\nIn the text, B&A refer to my package QCA as having: “… a number of shortcomings, especially when it comes to finding the complete space of viable models.”\nIt is highly ambiguous what these shortcomings really are, since the package QCA can find any solution package CNA can find, while it can additionally identify intermediate solutions which package CNA is unable to find (of course it was not built for that, but in my opinion that is a real shortcoming.)\nInstead, they points to package QCApro as if that package was somehow superior but fails to mention that package QCApro is a fork of the package QCA, and actually a fork of a very old version that is vastly outperformed by the newer algorithms.\nTo their credit, B&A does recognize the package QCA is the “only” QCA package in R that allows setting consistency and coverage thresholds, thus by logical implication they admit that package QCApro has limited functionality.\nWhat they refer to as “shortcomings”, it is in fact a matter of defaults. A fresh reader of his description might be tempted to believe package QCA cannot find “the complete space of viable models”, which would be a false conclusion. In fact, package QCA can find the complete space, by properly setting the argument \"all.sol\" to TRUE, in function minimize(). It is a matter of default values, not about limited functionality.\nFurther into the manuscript, B&A also refer to my CCubes minimization algorithm, and describe it as accepting: “… much more fine-grained fit parameters and its bottom-up approach may generate models that differ from standard QCA models. CCubes is not equivalent to standard QCA algorithms; its models often significantly outperform common QCA models in model fit”\nBut that is, of course, not true. CCubes generates exactly the same solutions as standard QCA. It has been thoroughly tested and validated against Ragin’s fs/QCA software, as well as against Tosmana.\nSo a confusion is introduced between what an algoritm is and what it can do. While CCubes can do everything CNA does, this should not mean CCubes is the same thing with CNA. In fact, as shown in section 10.2 on Coincidence Analysis from my newest book, CCubes is superior to CNA even for CNA-related purposes.\nAnd neither should it mean CCubes is something different than standard QCA. Rather, and I repeat, it is a matter of options: with proper (and default!) settings, CCubes literally matches standard QCA.\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{dușa2019,\n  author = {Dușa, Adrian},\n  title = {CCubes and {CNA}},\n  date = {2019-10-25},\n  url = {https://adriandusa.eu/posts/2019-10-25-ccubes-and-cna/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDușa, Adrian. 2019. “CCubes and CNA.” October 25, 2019. https://adriandusa.eu/posts/2019-10-25-ccubes-and-cna/."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Collaboration and its promotion by funders continue to accelerate. Although research has identified significant transaction costs associated with collaboration, little empirical work has examined the broader, societal-level economic outcomes of a resource-sharing environment. Does an environment that encourages collaboration shift our focus toward certain types of social objectives and away from others? This paper uses agent-based Monte Carlo simulation to demonstrate that collaboration is particularly useful when resources are rare but a social objective is commonly held. However, collaboration can lead to bad outcomes when the objective is not commonly shared; in such cases, markets outperform collaborative arrangements. These findings suggest that encouraging a resource-sharing environment can lead to inefficiencies even worse than market failure. We also demonstrate that failure to account for transaction costs when prescribing collaboration can result in quantifiably lower outcome levels than expected."

    "text": "My research is mainly focused on methodological aspects of the social science research. In particular, I have made a number of contributions to both the theory of the Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA), and also to the software implementation of this research method. My R package QCA is now the default standard for this type of research, being taught in university curricula and summer schools, all over the world.\nMy other research interest is related to data documentation. I strongly believe that data is useless, and its value decreases over time, unless we manage to establish a long term storage containing the context in which the data was collected. Such metadata (data about data) is handled by the Data Documentation Initiative (DDI) standard, for which I develop software (into another R package called DDIwR) that empowers researchs to quickly document their data and create a single XML document containing both data and metadata, for long term storage.\nFinally, it needs mentioning what I consider another one of my proud-worthy accomplishments, the R package declared. It tackles what many consider a serious shortcoming of the R statistical environment, the existence of a single missing value, called NA. But social sciences have many values to explain why a certain value is missing (maybe the respondend did not know what to respond, or might not have wanted to respond because of a too sensitive question, or simply the question was not applicable). Package declared makes it possible to declare value labels and missing values, and offers a wide range of functions to deal with these additional values that base R does not cover."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The main objective of the qualitative comparative analysis is to find solutions that display sufficient configurations of causal conditions leading to the presence of an outcome. These solutions should be less complex than the original observed configurations, as parsimonious as possible, without sacrificing the sufficiency requirement. Sufficiency and parsimony are two requirements that act in opposition, and an optimal solution is one that accommodates both. There are different search strategies that lead to different types of solutions, with an ongoing debate about which solution type is closest to the true, underlying causal structure. This article presents the different logics behind each simplification system in order to explain how and why they lead to different results and introduces the concept of “robust sufficiency” to clear the debate. It analyses the correctness ratios for the different solution type and provides an improved set of procedures to measure correctness that captures the best features from each system. Out of the competition between the conservative and the parsimonious search strategies, the intermediate solution emerges as the best hybrid that is suitable for causal analysis, outperforming the parsimonious solution in recovering a known (even parsimonious) causal structure."

    "text": "I’ve recently came across a recent manuscript called called “Optimizing Consistency and Coverage in Configurational Causal Modeling”, by Michael Baumgartner and Mathias Ambühl (in the next sections, abbreviated as B&A).\nB&A propose an interesting method to find the optimal thresholds for consistency and coverage, to recover the underlying causal structure.\nWithout starting another debate around CNA vs. QCA, it remains to be seen (and I will probably test) if their idea to find such optimal thresholds is possible / desirable for QCA truth tables.\nThe purpose of this post is to offer some explanation, since the authors referred to my minimization algorithm called CCubes.\nIn the text, B&A refer to my package QCA as having: “… a number of shortcomings, especially when it comes to finding the complete space of viable models.”\nIt is highly ambiguous what these shortcomings really are, since the package QCA can find any solution package CNA can find, while it can additionally identify intermediate solutions which package CNA is unable to find (of course it was not built for that, but in my opinion that is a real shortcoming.)\nInstead, they points to package QCApro as if that package was somehow superior but fails to mention that package QCApro is a fork of the package QCA, and actually a fork of a very old version that is vastly outperformed by the newer algorithms.\nTo their credit, B&A does recognize the package QCA is the “only” QCA package in R that allows setting consistency and coverage thresholds, thus by logical implication they admit that package QCApro has limited functionality.\nWhat they refer to as “shortcomings”, it is in fact a matter of defaults. A fresh reader of his description might be tempted to believe package QCA cannot find “the complete space of viable models”, which would be a false conclusion. In fact, package QCA can find the complete space, by properly setting the argument \"all.sol\" to TRUE, in function minimize(). It is a matter of default values, not about limited functionality.\nFurther into the manuscript, B&A also refer to my CCubes minimization algorithm, and describe it as accepting: “… much more fine-grained fit parameters and its bottom-up approach may generate models that differ from standard QCA models. CCubes is not equivalent to standard QCA algorithms; its models often significantly outperform common QCA models in model fit”\nBut that is, of course, not true. CCubes generates exactly the same solutions as standard QCA. It has been thoroughly tested and validated against Ragin’s fs/QCA software, as well as against Tosmana.\nSo a confusion is introduced between what an algoritm is and what it can do. While CCubes can do everything CNA does, this should not mean CCubes is the same thing with CNA. In fact, as shown in section 10.2 on Coincidence Analysis from my newest book, CCubes is superior to CNA even for CNA-related purposes.\nAnd neither should it mean CCubes is something different than standard QCA. Rather, and I repeat, it is a matter of options: with proper (and default!) settings, CCubes literally matches standard QCA.\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{dușa2019,\n  author = {Dușa, Adrian},\n  title = {CCubes and {CNA}},\n  date = {2019-10-25},\n  url = {https://adriandusa.eu/posts/2019-10-25-ccubes-and-cna/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDușa, Adrian. 2019. “CCubes and CNA.” October 25, 2019. https://adriandusa.eu/posts/2019-10-25-ccubes-and-cna/."

    "title": "Multiple missing values in R? Solved.",
    "section": "",
    "text": "As a former SPSS trained user, ever since I started using R there was always a rather annoying background question: why is there a single missing value in base R, and why isn’t it possible to use more missing values?\nAs far as I understand, the main reason might have something to do with the scientific domain of the original R creators, who were definitely not from the social sciences. A single missing value is more than enough for any other scientific domain, and R simply went on the original design, ignoring the use of multiple missing values that are universally offered by all other major statistical software like SAS, SPSS and Stata.\nMore recently, some good initiatives led to the packages haven and labelled, who are almost (but not) perfect. In this post, I am going to write about my own solution to this situation, published on CRAN in the package declared.\nThis package offers a custom type of vector, that is not different from regular R vectors in the sense that it contains exactly the same missing values, so normal functionality is maintained for any statistical operation. What it additionally does, is to keep a record of the position of each and every missing value, and assign meaning to those positions. This way, it achieves the best of both worlds: declare and use multiple missing values, whilst being fully compatible with base R design.\nThe following is an illustrative example, for a hypothetical variable about the number of children in a household:\nlibrary(declared)\nchildren &lt;- declared(\n  c(2, -91, 0, 3, -92, 4, 2, 1, 0, 3, -91, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, -91, 2, 5, 2, 1, 3),\n  label = \"Number of children in the household\",\n  labels = c(\"Prefer not to say\" = -91, \"Not applicable\" = -92),\n  na_values = c(-91, -92)\n)\n#&gt; &lt;declared&lt;integer&gt;[22]&gt; Number of children in the household\n#&gt;  [1]       2 NA(-91)       0       3 NA(-92)       4       2       1       0\n#&gt; [10]       3 NA(-91)       0       1       2       1       0 NA(-91)       2\n#&gt; [19]       5       2       1       3\n#&gt; Missing values: -91, -92\n\n#&gt; Labels:\n#&gt;  value             label\n#&gt;    -91 Prefer not to say\n#&gt;    -92    Not applicable\nThe values -91 and -92 are properly declared and recognised as missing, as it can be seen in the print method which prepends the NA in front of the value.\nLet’s see how this vector looks in base R:\nbaseRchildren &lt;- drop(children)\n#&gt; [1]  2 NA  0  3 NA  4  2  1  0  3 NA  0  1  2  1  0 NA  2  5  2  1  3\nAny statistical operation, even basic descriptives, on such vectors results into an NA:\nmean(baseRchildren)\n#&gt; [1] NA\nIn R, the value NA is equivalent to an empty cell (with no information about why it is missing) and this requires attention. To obtain the expected result, one has to employ the argument na.rm (remove missing values before calculating the mean), deactivated by default to alert users about potential problems in the data.\nmean(baseRchildren, na.rm = TRUE)\n#&gt; [1] 1.777778\nHowever, in this particular example the values are not “empty”. There are particular and known reasons for each value where the number of children is not provided, hence these values should not be problematic. Package declared solves this by default:\nmean(children)\n#&gt; [1] 1.777778\nIn this example, the argument na.rm is not necessary because the (declared) NA values are not empty cells, despite being stored as regular NA values. For this reason, a dedicated function is provided, called is.empty(), to differentiate between pure NA and the four declared missing values:\nsum(is.na(children))\n#&gt; [1] 4\n\nsum(is.empty(children))\n#&gt; [1] 0\n\n# adding one pure empty value\nsum(is.empty(c(children, NA)))\n#&gt; [1] 1\nDeclared vectors are useful for both numeric and categorical variables. In fact, missing values can be recorded no matter what kind of variables there are in a dataset. In addition to declaring such values, it is in fact possible to also declare value labels for the response categories, to create a special kind of object that is inbetween numerical vectors and R factors.\norientation &lt;- declared(\n  c(1:3, -91),\n  labels = c(\"Left\" = 1, \"Middle\" = 2, \"Right\" = 3, \"Don't know\" = -91),\n  na_value = -91,\n  label = \"Respondent's political orientation\"\n)\n#&gt; &lt;declared&lt;integer&gt;[4]&gt; Respondent's political orientation\n#&gt; [1]       1       2       3 NA(-91)\n#&gt; Missing values: -91\n\n#&gt; Labels:\n#&gt;  value     label\n#&gt;     1       Left\n#&gt;     2     Middle\n#&gt;     3      Right\n#&gt;   -91 Don't know\nThis is a typical example of a categorical variable, with all values corresponding to certain ordered categories. The only possible way to emulate this in base R is to use a factor:\nfactor(\n  c(\"Left\", \"Middle\", \"Right\", \"Don't know\"),\n  levels = c(\"Left\", \"Middle\", \"Right\", \"Don't know\"),\n  ordered = TRUE\n)\n#&gt; [1] Left       Middle     Right      Don't know\n#&gt; Levels: Left &lt; Middle &lt; Right &lt; Don't know\nR factors are unable to differentiate between valid categories and those which should be treated as missing, and the order of the categories needs to be specified separately using the argument levels. In addition, the original (questionnaire) values are lost, for instance the value -91 can not be preserved.\nUnlike R factors, in the declared counterpart the values are still there, and labels are assigned for each category. To meet the expectations of various statistical procedures that allow for categorical variables, the function as.factor() coerces the vector:\nas.factor(orientation, ordered = TRUE)\n#&gt; [1] Left   Middle Right  &lt;NA&gt;\n#&gt; Levels: Left &lt; Middle &lt; Right\nThis is the expected behavior, since the value -91 corresponding to the category “Don’t know” is to be treated as missing, anyways. The declared missing values are correctly coerced to base R NA values.\nThere are many other utility functions in this package, probably too many to describe in a single post. Interested readers are invited to visit the package’s Vignettes from its dedicated r-universe webpage: https://dusadrian.r-universe.dev/declared\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{dușa2023,\n  author = {Dușa, Adrian},\n  title = {Multiple Missing Values in {R?} {Solved.}},\n  date = {2023-07-16},\n  url = {https://adriandusa.eu/posts/2023-07-16-missing-values-in-R/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDușa, Adrian. 2023. “Multiple Missing Values in R?

    "text": "The European Social Survey is the most advanced academic survey in Europe, with over 20 years of collecting data every two years.\nIt is organised on rounds, with core and rotating modules which means questions names (or numbers) are not fixed from one round to another. To integrate the datasets from multiple countries and multiple rounds, ESS uses a mnemonic system, for instance PPLTRST referring to the question if most people can be trusted. This question was named A4 in round 8 and it can have different other names in other rounds.\nWhile using a mnemonic system is the only solution with integrated data files, it makes the life of regular users somewhat difficult if searching for a particular variable in a particular round. The connection with the questionnaire gets lost, as the name A4 from the questionnaire is not found in the dataset for round 8.\nIt is in fact a Frequently Asked Question, found in the Data section at question: “How do I use question numbers as variable names?”. The ESS provided solution is to use software specific script files, and rename variables from the mnemonic system to the actual question names from the ESS questionnaire.\nThe current scripts cover the needs of most ESS users, with different versions written for SAS, SPSS and Stata. However (and this is a general matter which will soon be addressed by ESS) there is no such script for the R programming environment, which is also in high demand.\nUntil there will be an R version of the ESS datasets, one possible solution is to download any of the currently provided versions (for instance SPSS) and convert it into an R data frame using the package DDIwR. The big advantage of this package, besides converting to and from various statistical software, is to create a special type of R object where each variable is a vector of class “declared”, via another recent package called declared, which allows R users to define specific missing values in a similar fashion as most users do in SPSS, Stata or SAS (this was not directly possible until now, given that base R has one and only one type of missing value, NA).\nBelow is an actual example of how to convert, also containing the code to rename the ESS round 8 variables:\n# Encoding: UTF-8.\n# RENAME ESS round 8\n# The program renames variable names from mnemomic to question numbers,\n# for example NWSPOL to A1.\n# Exceptions are country specific variables (party, education etc.)\n# and variables from the household grid (F2, F3 and F4).\n# -----\n\noldvar &lt;- c(\n    \"nwspol\", \"netusoft\", \"netustm\", \"ppltrst\", \"pplfair\", \"pplhlp\", \"polintr\",\n    \"psppsgva\", \"actrolga\",

    "text": "The upcoming release version 3.23 of the package QCA will bring a significant speed increase for the minimization process, by a factor of about 10 times on my computer. This achievement has two sources:\n\nparallelizing the search process to find the prime implicants\nadding the option to use the Gurobi optimizer for solving the prime implicants chart\n\nThe parallelization process is made possible by using the OpenMP API, which is available on most modern systems. Depending on the workstation’s architecture, the speed increase is larger and larger the more cores are available. In my case, the parallelization accounts for about 7 times, on a MacBookPro with a M2 Max processor having 12 cores.\nUsing OpenMP, however, is not automatically enabled by the CRAN servers. It needs to be installed by the user on the local machine, and at least for the MacOS systems CRAN has some detailed instructions on how to do this. I did not find similar instructions for the Windows systems, but I assume that Rtools should be installed.\nThese command line tools are necessary to re-build the package QCA from source, to enable the OpenMP API. Installing this local version of the package, assuming that OpenMP is available, will do the trick.\nThe next speed improvement factor is due to the Gurobi optimizer. By default, the package QCA uses the open source lpSolve package to solve the prime implicants chart. This is a very good solver, but it has obvious limits at very large and sparce such charts. Gurobi, on the other hand, is a different story. It is the fastest, industrial strength solver, that was recently made freely available for academic users.\n\n\n\nThe figure above shows the difference in speed between Gurobi and lpSolve, for randomly generated PI charts with 60 to 70 columns (the equivalent of the observed positive configurations / minterms in QCA) and 1000 prime implicants on the rows. The difference is almost exponential, in some situations Gurobi is up to 100 times faster, with an average of 35 times for the maximum of 70 columns.\nWhen package QCA detects the Gurobi solver, it will use that instead of lpSolve, and revert back only if there is something wrong in the solving process (for instance Gurobi might not find a valid license, and stop with an error).\nKudos to the Gurobi team for making this solver available, it makes a massive point of improvement for the Boolean minimization process. Users have to register on the Gurobi website, using their institutional email address, and request an academic license key that can be used to activate the Gurobi package. They also provide clear instructions on how to install the R package gurobi.\nOnce these are installed, package QCA will do the rest and, function of the number of available cores, will show a dramatic increase in speed.\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{dușa2024,\n  author = {Dușa, Adrian},\n  title = {Significant Speed Increase in Package {QCA}},\n  date = {2024-10-03},\n  url = {https://adriandusa.eu/blog/2024-10-03-qca-openmp-gurobi/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDușa, Adrian. 2024. “Significant Speed Increase in Package\nQCA.” October 3, 2024. https://adriandusa.eu/blog/2024-10-03-qca-openmp-gurobi/."

This article presents the different logics behind each simplification system in order to explain how and why they lead to different results and introduces the concept of “robust sufficiency” to clear the debate. It analyses the correctness ratios for the different solution type and provides an improved set of procedures to measure correctness that captures the best features from each system.

    "section": "",
    "text": "The purpose of this paper is to address and test two assumptions on which csQCA is based, namely that csQCA will generate contradictions and low consistency scores if models are ill-specified. The first part of the paper introduces csQCA in general and as a stepwise approach. In a second part a real-life example is introduced with the purpose of illustrating how csQCA operates and as an input for a simulation in the subsequent part. The third part introduces contradictions, consistency, their interrelatedness and the assumptions which are made with regard to contradictions and consistency. Subsequently the assumptions are tested via a simulation on the basis of a csQCA analysis of over 5 million random datasets. The paper argues that researchers cannot always assume that csQCA will generate contradictions or low consistency scores when models are ill-specified. Such an assumption is only justified when csQCA applications take limitations with regard to model specification (the number of conditions and the number of cases) into account. Benchmark tables for model specification purposes are developed. Since these tables are based on a probability value of 0.5 the paper also tests the results for contradictions and consistency for the probabilities which were present in a real-life example. This test shows that the 0.5 probability generates an appropriate measure for the occurrence of contradictions and consistency indicating that the benchmark tables can be used for different applications with different distributions of 0’s and 1’s in the conditions and outcomes. The paper ends with a conclusion."

Starting with an overview of SSH infrastructures it elaborates on four specific areas that increasingly demand a pan-European approach. Drawing from the SSH infrastructure projects’ experience, it then (re-) defines the requirements and potential for next generation infrastructure projects. They highlight the developments and problems they anticipate, focussing in particular on advancing digitalisation in the SSH.\nThe book draws together the insights gained at a conference of the same name, “Facing the Future”, held in Berlin in November 2013. The conference was attended by 70 experts from 19 European countries who met to discuss the new challenges posed by the increasing necessity of integrating digital research tools into everyday working life. It was organised by the European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures (ESFRI), the federation of All European Academies (ALLEA), the Union of the German Academies of Sciences and Humanities, and the German Data Forum. It took place as part of a project financed by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) entitled Survey and Analysis of Basic Research in the Social Sciences and Humanities in Europe (SASSH).\nEchoes about the book, here.\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@book{dușa2014,\n  author = {Dușa, Adrian and Nelle, Dietrich and Stock, Günter and G.\n    Wagner, Gert},\n  publisher = {Scivero},\n  title = {Facing the {Future.} {European} {Research} {Infrastructures}\n    for the {Humanities} and {Social} {Sciences}},\n  date = {2014-09-01},\n  url = {https://adriandusa.eu/research/books/2014-FTF/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDușa, Adrian, Dietrich Nelle, Günter Stock, and Gert G.

    "text": "Starting with version 2.0, the QCA package in R witnessed substantial improvements in both the functionality of the written commands and also the Graphical User Interface. Considerable effort is made to maintain backwards compatibility with older versions of the package, so that previous publications could still be replicated with the current version, but the new features required an almost complete re-write of the previous book published at Springer.\nThis new book contains detailed explanations on how to perform QCA with R using the latest cutting edge developments, among which: better calibrations, improved dialogs in the GUI, expanded parameters of fit, native SOP expressions, conjunctural directional expectations, and the most advanced minimization engine called CCubes.\nThe online version of the book can be found on https://bookdown.org/dusadrian/QCAbook/.\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@book{dușa2019,\n  author = {Dușa, Adrian},\n  publisher = {Springer},\n  title = {QCA with {R.} {A} {Comprehensive} {Resource}},\n  date = {2019-06-01},\n  url = {https://adriandusa.eu/research/books/2019-QCA/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDușa, Adrian. 2019.
