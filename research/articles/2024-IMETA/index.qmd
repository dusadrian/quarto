## Abstract

Venn diagrams are widely used to illustrate relationships among multiple datasets. As one of the most popular data visualization platforms, the R programming language stands out with numerous packages, including VennDiagram, venn, and RVenn, designed for plotting Venn diagrams. Building upon the foundations laid by these existing tools, we developed ggVennDiagram. Due to the support for the grammar of graphics, precise region/subset filling, and some other easy-to-use features, the ggVennDiagram package has emerged as one of the most favored tools in this domain.
