## Context

At a time when the Romanian data archive did not exist, efforts were being made by the Institute for Quality of Life Research to organize its datasets in a systematic way, especially for comparative purposes. Feeling the potential of a data archive, following Western examples, the director of the institute Prof. Zamfir (then also the Dean of the Faculty of Sociology and Social Work) quickly realized that a Romanian data archive was necessary.

The initial name for this archive was RSDA, from the Romanian Social Data Archive, but its later trademark abbreviation changed to RODA, meaning the same thing.

This article describes the situation from that time, in a Romanian (social) scientific environment that was still in its infancy after having been oppressed for decades, by the communist regime, and the grass roots of what will eventually become a national data archive for the social sciences.
